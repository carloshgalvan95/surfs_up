# surfs_up

## Overview of the project
---
While on vacation in Hawaii last year, you discovered a new found passion for surfing. You've been trying to come up with a plan that will let you not just return to Hawaii, but live there forever, you finally come up with an idea that you think is foolproof.
A surf n shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourits, and of course, yourself. You have some savings you are willing to invest but will need some real investor backing to get this off the ground. After putting together a strong business plan you reach out to an investor, your first meeting with him goes extremely well but he has one concern. What about the weather?
he is extremely serious about this. He invested in a surf shop early in his career, however he didnt ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained down of existence. This time, to ensure success, we will be analysing the data from nine different probe stations to discover trends on temperature and comparing the fluctuation during different seasons using data for the months of June and December.

## Ice cream and surfing for everyone

After running and analysis, the data and trends we can observe for both months are as follow:
| June | December |

This will give us a general idea of what to expect during the main vacation seasons where we can observe an increase of tourists and therefore potential customers. We need to assure that the possible revenues for this two months are not meandered by bad weather on both temperature or precipitation.

### Temperature
- The samples we obtained from the station probes are within the same range for both months, that gives us safety on using both statistics head to head.
- First thing we can see is that the average temperature doesn't vary that much even taking in consideration we are analysing data from two different seasons, the weather is quite stable.
- The fact that the standard deviation is just 3 degrees is also reassuring, reinforce the hypothesis of a quite stable weather.
- Even thought our minimum temperatures are quite chilly, it's still a reasonable weather preferred by surfers due to increasing the probability of bigger waves.

### Precipitation
- The precipiation also doesn't vary that much depending on the season, we can see a bigger increase than the one observed with temperature, but the standard deviation and mean are still well below 1 or even 0.5.
- 50% of the days see next to no precipitation on both June and December.

## Summary

| June | December |
|------------------------|------------------------|

To sum it up. As observed on the plot above, the temperatures have almost a normal distribution with minimum variation between seasons. The fluctuation we see is within a couple of degrees from day to day, making it easy to predict exactly how the weather is going to be the next day or even the next month and we rarely see temperatures that won't be suitable for surfing with a side of ice cream.

| June | December |
|------------------------|------------------------|
|           ![june_prcp](https://github.com/carloshgalvan95/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/june_prcp.jpg)            |               ![dec_prcp](https://github.com/carloshgalvan95/surfs_up/blob/main/Resources/dec_prcp.jpg)         |

On the other hand, when dealing with precipitation we can expect an increase during the winter season, nevertheless, it's rarely above 1, and moderate rain is the preferred weather of a lot of surfist due to an increase in wave size.

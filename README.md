# surfs_up

## Overview of the project
---
While on vacation in Hawaii last year, you discovered a new found passion for surfing. You've been trying to come up with a plan that will let you not just return to Hawaii, but live there forever, you finally come up with an idea that you think is foolproof.
A surf n shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourits, and of course, yourself. You have some savings you are willing to invest but will need some real investor backing to get this off the ground. After putting together a strong business plan you reach out to an investor, your first meeting with him goes extremely well but he has one concern. What about the weather?
he is extremely serious about this. He invested in a surf shop early in his career, however he didnt ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained down of existence. This time, to ensure success, we will be analysing the data from nine different probe stations to discover trends on temperature and comparing the fluctuation during different seasons using data for the months of June and December.

## Ice cream and surfing for everyone

After running and analysis, the data and trends we can observe for both months are as follow:
